    <h1>When science comes to life</h1>
    <p>By Yanis Chouhib, published on October 22, 2025</p>

    <p>From Mary Anning, whose discoveries laid the foundations of modern paleontology, to Claire Dearing, operations manager
    of the Jurassic World park, emerges the story of women's struggle to exist and be recognized in a scientific and
    cultural world long dominated by men.</p>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>Released in 2015 and directed by Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World takes us back to Isla Nublar, twenty-two years after
    the events of Jurassic Park. A massive dinosaur-themed amusement park opens its doors to the public under the name
    Jurassic World. Claire Dearing is the island’s operations manager. To attract more visitors, her team decides to create
    a new hybrid dinosaur: the Indominus rex, an intelligent and fearsome creature. But the experiment goes disastrously
    wrong when the monster escapes its enclosure, causing panic and destruction on the island. Facing this crisis, Claire
    turns to Owen Grady, a velociraptor trainer, for help in stopping the creature. Together, they must show courage and
    careful thinking to save the visitors and regain control of the park.</p>

    <h3>Claire Dearing's Role in Jurassic World</h3>
    <p>Claire Dearing plays a central role in the daily management of Jurassic World as operations manager. Organized and
    methodical, she oversees security and makes key decisions to ensure the park runs smoothly. When the Indominus rex
    escapes and chaos ensues, Owen Grady takes charge in the field thanks to his dinosaur training experience. Despite his
    initiative, Claire retains authority and remains a major figure in coordinating efforts to save the park and its
    visitors.
    </p>


    <h3>Mary Anning's Research and Its Link to Jurassic World</h3>
    <p>Mary Anning revealed fascinating creatures to the world, such as the ichthyosaur, plesiosaur, and pterosaur, through her
    research on the Dorset coast. These fossils provided fundamental knowledge about prehistoric animals and their anatomy.
    Jurassic World draws direct inspiration from such paleontological work. The cloned dinosaurs in the park rely on
    discoveries like those made by Mary Anning. Without her pioneering research, the idea of a park filled with prehistoric
    creatures would have been unimaginable.</p>

    <h3>The Evolution of Women's Role in Science</h3>
    <p>Mary Anning worked in a context where women were often ignored or ridiculed, and her work was sometimes stolen or
    attributed to men. Today, Claire Dearing represents significant progress: she holds a respected leadership position,
    makes important decisions, and is recognized for her skills. The contrast between Mary and Claire illustrates the path
    women have traveled in science and leadership—from near invisibility to positions of power and respect.</p>
