    <h1>Beneath the Cliffs of Dorset</h1>

    <p>By Yanis Chouhib, published on October 22, 2025</p>

    <p>At the origin of decisive discoveries on fossilized marine reptiles, Mary Anning revolutionized science without ever
    receiving the recognition she deserved. Her works, often published under other names, reveal a brilliance long rendered
    invisible.</p>

    <h3>Mary Anning's Discoveries</h3>
    <p>Mary Anning made several major discoveries in paleontology during the early 19th century. At just 12 years old, she and
    her brother discovered the first complete ichthyosaur skeleton on the beaches of Dorset, a marine reptile from the
    Jurassic era. Yet the scientific publication was signed by the British geologist Henry De la Beche, who benefited from
    her observations without crediting her. In 1823, she unearthed the first complete plesiosaur specimen, which was
    presented to the Geological Society of London by the British paleontologist William Conybeare, who dismissed her as
    merely an amateur. In 1828, she identified a fossilized pterodactyl the first specimen discovered outside Germany but
    the find was officially reported by another British paleontologist, William Buckland. She also discovered fossils such
    as belemnites with their fossilized ink sacs, enriching the understanding of Jurassic marine life. Her research focused
    on the Jurassic Coast of Dorset, a region especially rich in fossils dating from 201 to 145 million years ago. Each
    fossil was carefully extracted, prepared, and studied, providing specimens of remarkable scientific quality.</p>

    <h3>Impact on the Scientific and Cultural World</h3>
    <p>These discoveries had a profound impact on science and the understanding of natural history. They provided substantial
    evidence for the extinction of species, challenging the prevailing belief in the immutability of living creations. The
    fossils supported Georges Cuvier's research on species extinction and helped establish paleontology as a rigorous
    scientific discipline. They also enhanced comprehension of the past diversity of marine life and paved the way for
    Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Despite initial controversy and skepticism, Anning's discoveries gradually
    transformed scientific and cultural perceptions of Earth's history. Today, they continue to influence research and
    museum studies, highlighting the importance of meticulous observation and systematic study of fossils in understanding
    the evolution of species and ancient ecosystems.</p>
