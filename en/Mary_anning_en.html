        <h1>Mary Anning, a Forgotten Discoverer of Science</h1>


        <p>By Yanis Chouhib, published on October 22, 2025</p>


        <p>Mary Anning revealed the traces of a vanished world, laying the foundations for modern paleontology. Yet, his
            major
            discoveries were often attributed to men, a symbol of an even too frequent erasure of women in the history
            of science.</p>


        <p>Mary Anning was born in 1799 in Lyme Regis, a modest coastal town in southern England known for its
            fossil-rich cliffs.
            Coming from a poor family, she grew up in humble surroundings, but her curiosity and love of nature showed
            early. From
            childhood, she accompanied her father on the cliffs and beaches to search for fossils, which they sold to
            support the
            family. These expeditions, often dangerous due to unstable cliffs and storms, sharpened her keen sense of
            observation,
            patience, and meticulousness.</p>

        <p>At only twelve years old, Mary makes an exceptional discovery: the first complete skeleton of ichthyosaur, a
            marine
            reptile disappeared for millions of years. A few years later, she also brought to light a plesiosaur and the
            first
            pterodactyl ever identified in England. These discoveries, of paramount importance, upset the scientific
            knowledge of
            his time and gradually attract the attention of many researchers and naturalists. But Mary Anning undergoes
            the Matilda
            effect and her fossils are often studied and published by men like William Conybeare, Henry De la Beche, or
            William
            Buckland, without her being credited as a discoverer. Despite these invisibilizations, Mary Anning continues
            to
            document and classify her findings with remarkable precision. Her observations have laid the foundation for
            stratigraphy
            and modern paleontology, notably by demonstrating the existence of extinct species.</p>

        <p>Mary Anning died in 1847, but her legacy is vast. Her courage, thirst for knowledge, and passion for science
            continue to
            inspire generations of researchers, particularly women entering the sciences. Thanks to her, the world knows
            prehistoric
            creatures better, and her name remains forever linked to the lost worlds she helped reveal. Mary Anning
            stands as a
            symbol of tenacity, curiosity, and perseverance for all who explore the unknown.</p>
